# Tools and Technology

This project uses:

- **Microsoft Playwright**: Released in January 2020, Playwright is a modern browser automation tool developed by Microsoft. The Playwright C# plugin was created and is maintained by the Microsoft Playwright team. It enables .NET developers to use Playwright for browser automation and testing.

   - Official announcement: [Introducing Playwright for .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-playwright-for-net/)
   - Documentation: [Playwright .NET Docs](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro)
   - Microsoft Tech Blog: [Playwright for .NET Announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-playwright-for-net/)

- **NUnit**: NUnit is a popular unit testing framework for .NET, first released in 2002. It was created by Charlie Poole and is maintained by the NUnit team. NUnit provides attributes and assertions for writing and running automated tests.
  - Official announcement: [NUnit 3 Release](https://nunit.org/news/nunit-3-release.html)
  - Documentation: [NUnit Documentation](https://docs.nunit.org/)
  - Project site: [NUnit.org](https://nunit.org/)

- **Allure**: Allure is a flexible, lightweight test reporting tool, first released in 2013. It was created by the Yandex team and is maintained by the Allure community. Allure integrates with many test frameworks and CI systems to provide rich, interactive reports.
  - Official announcement: [Allure Framework](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2)
  - Documentation: [Allure Docs](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/)
  - Project site: [Allure Framework GitHub](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2)


## Why Use NUnit?

NUnit is chosen for this project because it is mature, widely adopted, and integrates seamlessly with .NET and CI tools. It offers:
- Rich attribute-based test definitions
- Strong assertion library
- Parallel test execution
- Excellent IDE and CI integration
- Active community and documentation


### Why NUnit was chosen by GitHub Copilot
- More flexible test case and fixture setup than MSTest
- More mature and feature-rich than xUnit.net for complex scenarios
- Better support for parameterized tests and custom attributes
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Works well with Playwright and Allure reporting

### Alternatives
- [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/): Released in 2007. A modern unit testing framework for .NET, designed for extensibility and community-driven development. It is known for its simple syntax and strong support for parallel test execution.
- [MSTest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest): Released in 2005. Microsoft's official test framework for .NET, integrated with Visual Studio and Azure DevOps. MSTest is easy to use and well-supported in enterprise environments.
- [MbUnit](https://github.com/mbunit/mbunit): Released in 2004. An older, extensible unit testing framework for .NET, known for its advanced test generation and combinatorial testing features. Development is largely discontinued.
- [Fixie](https://fixie.github.io/): Released in 2013. A convention-based test framework for .NET, allowing developers to define their own test conventions and behaviors. It is lightweight and highly customizable.

# CI/ CD with GitHub Actions

## Brief History of GitHub Actions Workflows

GitHub Actions was announced by GitHub in 2018 as a new way to automate software workflows directly in repositories. It enables CI/CD, automation, and custom workflows using YAML files. GitHub Actions became generally available in November 2019, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy code with integrated automation.

- Official announcement: [GitHub Actions: Automate your workflow](https://github.blog/2018-10-17-robotic-workflows-github-actions/)
- General availability: [GitHub Actions is now generally available](https://github.blog/2019-11-13-github-actions-now-generally-available/)
- Documentation: [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Running GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow `playwright-tests` will run automatically:

- On every push to the `main` branch
- On every pull request targeting the `main` branch

To trigger the workflow manually:
1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   - `git push origin main`
2. Or create a pull request to `main`
3. The workflow will execute and generate Allure test reports in CI


# How GitHub Copilot Created This Project

### Prompts Used
- Create an automated test framework called "login-c-sharp". Tests will be in "login-c-sharp/e2e". Page Objects will be in "login-c-sharp/e2e/pages". It will be testing https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
- Continue with #new workspace setup
- We are using Playwright and C#.
- Verify the tests run
- Add to README how to setup development locally on 1) Windows 11 machine 2) On a Macbook
- Push this project to my Github.
- Create a GitHub Action workflow that runs automated tests, configured with Allure reports.
- Change it to playwright-tests.yml
- have two stages for testing and then reporting.
- Add to the readme how to kick off GitHub Actions workflow playwright-tests.
- At the end of the Readme, write a section "Generated by GitHub Copilot" summerizing what prompts were used, and what commands GitHub Copilot then executed.

### Commands Executed
- `dotnet new nunit -o .`
- `dotnet add package NUnit`
- `dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright`
- `dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI`
- `powershell bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install`
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet test`
- `git init`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Initial Playwright C# test framework setup"`
- Created .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml (and renamed from playwright-allure.yml)
- Used GitHub Actions steps for checkout, setup-dotnet, install dependencies, install Playwright browsers, run tests, upload artifacts, generate Allure report
- Updated README.md and copilot-instructions.md

### How GitHub Copilot Added Allure Reports
GitHub Copilot added Allure reporting based on the prompt: "Create a GitHub Action workflow that runs automated tests, configured with Allure reports." Copilot used knowledge of common C# test reporting practices and public documentation for Allure, NUnit, and Playwright integration. It included:
- Adding Allure.Commons and NUnit.Allure packages to test dependencies
- Configuring test results output to the `allure-results` directory
- Using the `simple-elf/allure-report-action` GitHub Action to generate and upload Allure reports

This ensured the CI pipeline produces and publishes Allure test reports automatically.

### Documentation Prompts Used

The following prompts were used to generate and update project documentation:
- Add to README how to setup development locally on Windows 11 and Macbook
- Add a section documenting project structure
- Add a section "Tools and technology" that gives a brief history of the tool, date it was released
- Add information about the Playwright + C# plugin. Who created it. Add documentation links to announcements in Microsoft tech blogs
- Add the same for NUnit and Allure
- Why use NUnit? List other alternatives, and list why NUnit is better
- Provide links for all Alternatives and describe them
- Add the year these alternatives were released
- Right after # CI/ CD with GitHub Actions give a brief history of GitHub Action Workflows, linking to official blog posts and announcements when and how it was created
